## FINDINGS:
* Security threads are increasing as per analysis of security commits in open source projects.
* As an average an security vulnerability commit is commited after every 100 days.
* In Python Security Commit is commited after every 50 days and in JavaScript after 32.5 days.
* Python Community is faster in responding to security threads than JavaScript.
* Security vulnerabilities are increasing more in JavaScript Than Python
<br/>
* <b>Commits Tested: 6342
  * JavaScript: 3458
  * Python: 2884</b>
  ## Personal Opinion:
    Security Risks in Every Language needs to be fixed ASAP and Increasing secuirity threads can effect programming field, especially web/cloud based applications are main target. therefore every Programmer needs to learn latest security techniques for present and future.
