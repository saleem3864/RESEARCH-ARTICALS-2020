## MOTIVE
To Provide Progrmmers an Virtural Reality facility for programming rather than sitting on an ordinary computer set. Virtual Reality method Includes an 3D veiw if relations of packages, classes or modules/functions. Along with an VR text editor for writting code with Virtual Mouse + Keyboard Using Trackers.
## FINDINGS:
* Correct Comprehensation of VR System is <b>65%</b> (attempted 93 code snippsets(70 were correct))
* Correct Comprehensation of Ordinary desktop/laptop System is <b>75%</b> (attempted 84 code snippsets(55 were correct))
* Virtual Reality has more Task Load and Physically and Mentally demanding.
* Programmers did not reported any difference in productivity in both systems.
## Personal Opinion:
It will be a good deal for Programmer who want to make programming a fun, they will be more easy with VR SYSTEM.
